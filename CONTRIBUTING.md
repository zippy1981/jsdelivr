### Web interface (Recommended)

*This is limited to projects that can be auto-updated by our bot. It requires github/npm/bower with tagged versions.*

1. Using your browser go to [files/][1] and use [Github's interface](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1834071/6826939/4019ce7a-d30d-11e4-8d1b-7821b923dd50.gif) to create a new folder with an info.ini file inside. [Documentation](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#file-structure)/[Example][2]
2. In the same directory create an update.json file to enable auto-updates. [Documentation](https://github.com/jsdelivr/libgrabber#add-updatejson-schema)/[Example](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/files/angular.moment/update.json)
3. Dont add any project related files. Our bot will add them after your PR gets merged
4. Make sure you do everything correctly the first time. If your PR exceeds 2 commits(1 per file) it will be declined.
5. Wait for approval!



### Advanced

 1. Fork the jsDelivr repository.
 2. Add files that you want to be synced with the CDN

  **Note** If there is a previous version of the project you are adding please ensure that the new version contains same files. For example if in the previous version there are both .min.js and .js files please add both to the new version.
  
  **Note** If you are adding a project for the first time please add only the minified version

 3. Send a pull request with a description of the changes you made including the source of the files. Please follow the same file structure as other projects in the repo.
 4. Wait for our approval.
 5. That's it!


File Structure
--------------
Under `files/` a directory for each project is created. Please follow the instructions below (exceptions are made on a per-case basis).

1. Names should be lowercase
2. No special characters or spaces, except for `. - _`.
3. Name should only contain the name of the project. (no versions or additional information)
4. If the project is a plugin of a library, prepend the name of the library, like `jquery.blurjs` or `bootstrap.select`.


A project's directory should contain the following:

1. An `info.ini` containing all needed information. [Example][2]
2. Directories named after the version of each project.
3. The version directories can contain in their names numbers, letters and `. - _`.
4. Do not create `latest` directories; they are automatically created on our side.

A version directory should contain the following:

1. Static files needed for the project to work.
2. If there is no minified version of the main JS/CSS file, please create your own using this ([minification tool][3]).
3. If there are official or expected source maps for the minified js, please include those in the folder.  Currently, the following projects officially support the `.map` files:
  * angularjs
  * jQuery
  * mithril
4. Do not upload useless files like demos, examples, licenses, readmes and any other files not being used in the production.
